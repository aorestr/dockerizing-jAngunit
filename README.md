# dockerizing-jAngunit
Let's build up my [jAngunit Angular app](https://github.com/aorestr/jAngunit) production version using Docker. Everything here has only be tested on _Elementary OS 5.1.5 Hera_ (based on _Ubuntu 18.04_)

## Docker

### Docker installation
I followed [this official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) to install the **Docker Engine**. I'm using **Docker** 19.03.11. If you don't want to run **Docker** as sudo, follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

### Build and run the app on the production container
I've created a Dockerfile that builds a Nginx server. The container downloads the latest updates of the repo directly from GitHub. Since it's just an example, I haven't applied any custom configuration for Nginx.

In order to build the production image run:
```
docker build -t jangunit-app:prod -f Dockerfile .
```
And to run it:
```
docker run --rm -ti -p 4270:80 --name=jangunit-container jangunit-app:prod
```
Your app will be available at "http://localhost:4270/".

## KubectlKubernetes

We can use use **Kubernetes** for orchestating our container.

### Kubernetes installation
I gather here all the necessary step to make **Kubernetes** work in a OS like mine. You will need not only Kubectl but also **Minikube** to make things work on a local environment.
```
# Install Kubectl
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y kubectl
# Install Minikube
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube_1.11.0-0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i minikube_latest_amd64.deb
```
Run `minikube start` and you are ready to go.

### Deploy application using Kubernetes
Since no image of the app has been pulled, we will need to use our own local **Docker** images. In order to do that, we have to build the Docker image using the **Minikube** Docker environment. Do the following then:
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t jangunit-app:prod -f Dockerfile .
```
So we now have an image to be used by **Kubernetes**. Now run the pod through the already existing manifest:
```
kubectl apply -f jangunit-app.yaml
```
We are using _Minikube_, so no external IP will be actually deploy. We can expose one though thanks to the `minikube tunnel` command. Run it on a separate terminal.

Now run `kubectl get services` and you will see the load balancer service we have created. It has an external IP related. Copy it and then paste it on your browser. Voil√†. The Angular application will be right before your eyes.
